        Shivu grows up to be an ambitious and mischievous child, obsessed with the goal of ascending the mountain, curious to explore what is the top. Despite Sanga's continuous pleas, he constantly tries and fails repeatedly, albeit improving at each attempt. At the young age of 25, he is shown to possess superhuman strength when he lifts a Lingam of Shiva and placing it at the foot of the mountain. He later finds a mask that has apparently fallen from the top of the mountain. Realizing it may possess feminine features, he is motivated to scale the mountain and succeeds, albeit with difficulty. At the top, he witnesses a woman named Avantika slaying Mahishmati soldiers. He discovers that she is a warrior from a local resistance tribe, dedicated with the aim of overthrowing the tyrannical king of Mahishmati, Lord Bhallaladeva (Bhalvalathevan) and rescuing an important captive - Princess Devasena, who happens to be the sister of the resistance's chief, Jaya Varma. Shivu is instantly smitten with Avantika and secretly follows her, even managing to draw a tattoo on her hand (while she is sleeping). Avantika is later tasked with rescuing Devasena. She discovers about Shivu and attacks him, but Shivu overpowers her and returns her mask to her. Realizing that he had scaled the mountain just for her, she reciprocates his feelings.

The pair are later attacked by more soldiers from Mahishmati. Overpowering them, Shivu pledges to rescue Devasena and departs. He secretly enters Mahishmati on Bhalladeva's birthday and discreetly assists in erecting a gigantic statue of Bhalla. In the process, he is apparently identified by a worker, who along with the other workers, chant the name 'Baahubali', much to Shivu's confusion and Bhalla's embarrassment. Shivu later infiltrates the royal palace disguised as a soldier and causes a commotion, allowing Bhalla and his guards to be distracted long enough for him to rescue Devasena. Bhalla dispatches Bhadra, his adoptive son and Kattappa, his loyal slave to recapture Devasena. They manage to do so, but Shivu manages to overpower them and beheads Bhadra, exactly at the moment when Sanga, the Amburis, Avantika and her compatriots arrive. Infuriated, Kattappa lunges at Shivu, but stops short of attacking him upon catching a glimpse of his face. He falls into submission at Shivu's feet, proclaiming him as 'Baahubali'.

The next morning, a now friendly Kattappa explains to Shivu about his true origins. Shivu is actually Mahendra Baahubali, the son of a famous warrior prince of Mahishmati - Amarendra Baahubali. Kattapa then narrates the past - Amarendra was born as an orphan; his father, King Vikramadeva had died before he was born and his mother had died giving birth to him. Lord Bijjaladeva, Vikramadeva's brother and the next-in-line in the Mahishmati royal family, was denied the throne, due to his cunning and deranged nature. Bijjaladeva's wife, Lord Sivagami, assumed power as an acting monarch, with the intention of raising both Bhalla (who happenned to be her son) and Amarendra, in an equal manner, in order to appropriately select the next heir to the throne of Mahishmati. Bhalla and Amarendra are both raised equally and trained rigorously in the arts of warfare, mathematics, administration, logic and numerous other subjects. Bijjaladeva, keen on making his son the next king, encourages Bhalla to do what ever it takes to ascend the throne; as a result Bhalla treats his subjects with cruelty and unmindfulness. Amarendra, on the other hand, grows up to be more mature and gains popularity in the kingdom
