The pair are later attacked by more soldiers from Mahishmati. Overpowering them, Shivu pledges to rescue Devasena and departs. He secretly enters Mahishmati on Bhalladeva's birthday and discreetly assists in erecting a gigantic statue of Bhalla. In the process, he is apparently identified by a worker, who along with the other workers, chant the name 'Baahubali', much to Shivu's confusion and Bhalla's embarrassment. Shivu later infiltrates the royal palace disguised as a soldier and causes a commotion, allowing Bhalla and his guards to be distracted long enough for him to rescue Devasena. Bhalla dispatches Bhadra, his adoptive son and Kattappa, his loyal slave to recapture Devasena. They manage to do so, but Shivu manages to overpower them and beheads Bhadra, exactly at the moment when Sanga, the Amburis, Avantika and her compatriots arrive. Infuriated, Kattappa lunges at Shivu, but stops short of attacking him upon catching a glimpse of his face. He falls into submission at Shivu's feet, proclaiming him as 'Baahubali'
